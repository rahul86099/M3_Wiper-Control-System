# Abstract

A windshield wiper, also known as a wiper blade, is a device that cleans the front window of a car of rain, snow, ice, washer fluid, and water.
Wipers are mounted on all heavy motor vehicles, including cars, trucks, railroad locomotives, and some aircraft.
After reading various research articles, I realised that safety standards for motor vehicles in inclement weather are important even at low speeds, therefore I began developing a wiper control system employing arm-based microcontrollers.
Rubber blades are affixed to the metal arms, while pivot magnets are attached to the other ends.
