# Abstract
A windshield wiper, also known as a wiper blade, is a device that cleans the front window of a car of rain, snow, ice, washer fluid, and water.
Wipers are mounted on all heavy motor vehicles, including cars, trucks, railroad locomotives, and some aircraft.
After reading various research articles, I realised that safety standards for motor vehicles in inclement weather are important even at low speeds, therefore I began developing a wiper control system employing arm-based microcontrollers.
Rubber blades are affixed to the metal arms, while pivot magnets are attached to the other ends.

# Description
•	A wiper is a necessary component that cleans raindrops or any other liquid off the vehicle's windscreen. The prior system required manual wiper activation, and the operation of bringing up the wiper was difficult to manage.

•	The rubber blade, the wiper arm that holds the blade, a spring linkage, and portions of the wiper pivots are all visible from the outside of the car. The wiper contains six elements termed pressure points or claws, which are little arms underneath the wiper.

•	The driver must turn on and off the control stalk, which will cause the driver to lose concentration while driving. As a result, this method is designed to address all of these issues.

•	Bad weather, risky driving conditions, and exhaustion can all cause a motorist to become distracted.

# Key Features
•	Each wiper has its own on/off button, and the fore and aft wipers are grouped together for on/off control at the same time.

•	The wipers are in harmony with one another. Spraying, wiping, and purging are all included in the washing function.

•	Low/High Speed, Heating, and Washing functions are all controlled by separate Aft and Fore buttons. The Interval+/Interval- pushbuttons can be used to change the interval in Low Speed mode.

# State of Art
•	Wiper Operator Panel for flush panel mounting in bridge console. Inside the bridge console.

•	Inside the bridge console, there is a Wiper Controller for din-rail mounting.

# Application
•	It's found in four-wheelers.

•	It's utilised in planes.

•	It's found in six-wheelers.

•	It is used in trains.

# Advantages
•	Power usage is reduced.

•	The operating premise is simple. The setup is straightforward.

•	By offering an On/Off switch, it is possible to run manually or automatically.

•	Because conductive sensors are used, sensor costs are very inexpensive.

•	Free from wear adjustment.
