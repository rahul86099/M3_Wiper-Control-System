# DESCRIPTION
• A wiper is a necessary component that cleans raindrops or any other liquid off the vehicle's windscreen. The prior system required manual wiper activation, and the operation of bringing up the wiper was difficult to manage.

• The rubber blade, the wiper arm that holds the blade, a spring linkage, and portions of the wiper pivots are all visible from the outside of the car. The wiper contains six elements termed pressure points or claws, which are little arms underneath the wiper.

• The driver must turn on and off the control stalk, which will cause the driver to lose concentration while driving. As a result, this method is designed to address all of these issues.

• Bad weather, risky driving conditions, and exhaustion can all cause a motorist to become distracted.

# RESEARCH
This application was developed utilising information obtained from a variety of sources (including YouTube, Google, and research publications), and then adapted into a successful working model application of wiper control using arm-based microcontrollers.

# OBJECTIVE
* Crystal vision in adverse weather conditions.
* With latest mechanism it can ensure the safety and lower down the accidents.
* Motor vehicle wiper control system.
* Interested in learning more about carriers in embedded systems.
* When you realise the necessity of safety management and begin to take responsibility for your own health while driving in inclement weather.
* This can be utilised in daily life by the user to track their safety and produce better results in life while travelling by motor vehicle.

# How we can do?
The location of the wiper is shown by an LED, which returns to its original position after cleaning the windsheet of a car.
